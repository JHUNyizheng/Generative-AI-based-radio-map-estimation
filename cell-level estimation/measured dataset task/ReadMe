The radio maps and statistical analyses estimated from the trained SPM, UNet, and GAN are available in each of these three directories.

building_bs_spm: radio maps estimated by SPM model.
label_inference_unet: radio maps estimated by UNet model.
label_inference_gan: radio maps estimated by GAN model.
